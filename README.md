## Indicator Buffers

## Custom Indicator Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets the indicator buffers, label, and returns the initialization success.

## Custom Indicator Iteration Function

The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It calculates the trend channel and generates buy/sell signals based on the calculated values.

The function iterates through the price data and calculates the sum of the high and low values for the specified period. Using this sum, it calculates the upper and lower channel values with the help of the deviation multiplier.

The calculated upper and lower channel values are stored in the respective buffers. Additionally, the function filters the signals based on the close price. If the close price is above the upper channel, a buy signal is generated. If the close price is below the lower channel, a sell signal is generated. Otherwise, no signal is generated.

The function returns the total number of calculated bars.
